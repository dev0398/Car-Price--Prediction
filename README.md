This project is a step by step process of how to build a car selling price prediction . We will first build a model using sklearn and different-different algorithms using CarDekho India dataset from kaggle.com.
During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, feature engineering, randomsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code as IDE
Streamlit to built web app
Heroku to deploy and manage web apps
